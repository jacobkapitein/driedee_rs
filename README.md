# driedee_rs

driedee_rs is a little fun project I'm working on to familiarize myself with graphics programming and the Rust programming language.

This code is mostly inspired by the 3D graphics "code-it-yourself" video's from [javidc9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9).

This code is in no way efficient, fast or good. But it does work.
