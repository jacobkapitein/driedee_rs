# driedee_rs

driedee_rs is a little fun project I'm working on to familiarize myself with graphics programming and the Rust programming language.

This code is mostly inspired by the 3D graphics "code-it-yourself" video's from [javidc9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9).

This code is in no way efficient, fast or good. But it does work.

## How to run

- Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/
- Run `cargo run` in the terminal, in the root folder of this project

First time running might take a while to install the dependencies. After that, each run should be pretty quick.

Again, this is just for learning, and optimization is really bad.

## Controls

Controls are a bit funky, but they work.

- W: Move forward
- S: Move backward
- D: Turn right
- A: Turn left
- Arrow up: Move up
- Arrow down: Move down
- Arrow left: buggy move left
- Arrow right: buggy move right
